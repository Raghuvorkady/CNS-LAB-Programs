1. [Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped.](Part%20A/program1)
2. [Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion.](Part%20A/program2)
3. [Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.](Part%20A/program3)
4. [Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets.](Part%20A/program4)
5. [Implement and study the performance of GSM on NS2/NS3 (Using MAC layer) or equivalent environment.](Part%20A/program5)
6. [Implement and study the performance of CDMA on NS2/NS3 (Using stack called Call net) or equivalent environment](Part%20A/program6)
